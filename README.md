A short quiz game on the fundamentals of javascript

## Description

A quiz game, using javascript functions to change the text content of a div to display different questions and answer choices. Each choice is clickable, and whenever the user selects a wrong answer, time is deducted from the clock. Once the clock reaches 0, or the user answers all the questions, the user is prompted to input their name, and their name and score is then saved to local storage and the highscores are displayed on the screen. The user may also view the highscores through a separate page.
